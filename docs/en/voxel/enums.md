# Enumerations (enums)
Enumerations are a compile-time language feature of Voxel that allow a set of discrete named values to be created. These values are statically converted into numbers at compile-time and inlined into the generated bytecode. Enumerations are defined by providing a name for the full set of entries and a name for each entry in the enumeration (and optionally an assigned numerical value).

Here is an example of an enumeration to describe a number of modes of transport:

```voxel
enum ModeOfTransport {
    WALKING = 0,
    BICYCLE,
    CAR,
    BUS,
    TRAIN,
    BOAT,
    AEROPLANE
}
```

Here, the entry `ModeOfTransport.WALKING` is explicitly assigned the value `0`. All other values will automatically be assigned an implicit, unique value when compiled. Explicitly assigned values must be number literals. Enumerated values can then be stored in variables:

```voxel
import io;

var outboundMode = ModeOfTransport.BUS;
var returnMode = ModeOfTransport.TRAIN;

if (outboundMode == ModeOfTransport.BUS) {
    io.println("Please ensure that you check the bus timetable before you leave as the buses are no longer every 15 minutes.");
}
```

Implicitly generated values for entries that have not been assigned an explicit value will be **globally unique** â€” that is, they will not share a generated implicit value that is equal to any other value in the same enumeration (including **explicit** values) or is equal to any **implicit** value (excluding **explicit** values) of other enums, both in the same module or other present modules. This is to ensure that when comparing entries of different enumerations, the result is `false`. Explicitly assigned values are allowed to be non-unique.
